# Neural-Network-CPP
This is an example of building a super-fast neural network using C++.


This article explains how to create a super-fast Artificial Neural Network that can crunch millions of data points withing seconds! even milliseconds. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are nowadays one of the most trending topics among computer geeks. Data scientists are being hired by tech giants for their excellence in these fields.

## Why use C++
Now, if you have already implemented a neural network model in some other programming language then you might have noticed (Especially, if we have a low-end PC ) that your models work pretty slow on even small datasets. When you began learning about Neural Networks you might have googled Which language is best for machine learning? and the obvious answer you get is Python or R is best for machine learning, other languages are hard so you must not waste your time on them!. Now, if the user starts programming, they face the problem of time and resource consumption. So, this article shows how to a super fast neural network.
